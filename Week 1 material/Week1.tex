\documentclass[12pt]{article} %the whole document will be in 12 pt
\date{} %this will remove the date from your document (it’s included by default)  
\usepackage{amsmath} %allows you to do some fancy math stuff that you wouldn’t have been able to do otherwise (we’ll come back to this)
\title{This is Your Title} %use “\title{\LaTeX ________}” to get the fancypants Latex typeset as your title
\author{Your Name}
 
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{This is a section}
%if you add an asterick (as in \section*{This is a section}, this section will not be numbered.
Now we can type away!

\subsection{Less than a section}
Hello World!
One next line does not make a new paragraph…

But two next lines do make a new paragraph!

\subsubsection{Hoagie on a Train section!}
Notice that the first paragraph is not indented, but we are!  The first paragraph is not intended by default, but the following new paragraphs will be.

\begin{center}
Centered paragraph  (equations are centered by default)
\end{center}
We are still in the same paragraph, but \textit{\textbf{not}} centered.

\paragraph{Ad Nauseum}
See what we did here?  Cool, huh?  Check out this equation inline : $x=y^{11}>\delta4\rho+\Delta x^5_\beta$  

Or an equation on its own line
\begin{equation}
\pi=\frac{22}{7}^{\circ}
%notice it’s automatically numbered (we’ll come back to this)
\end{equation}
